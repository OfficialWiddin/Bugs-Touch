# Bugs-Touch
A small iOS Game, made by me and a classmate.  

So you're supposed to play this with a friend (or more, up to a total of 5 players). The goal for each player is to draw a circle around your own bugs (your color) to combine the smaller bugs into bigger ones and once you only have one bug left, you win. The combining will be interrupted if there's any other colored bugs inside the circle or if your circle cross itself.

Unfortunately i have no video of the game but below you can view a set of images.

<b>Image 1 -</b> This is how it looks when you take your finger and draw a circle around two bugs.  
<b>Image 2 -</b> This is the result of two successfully combined bugs, which then results in a bigger bug.

<b>Image 3 -</b> The same as Image 1 but different bugs.    
<b>Image 4 -</b> This won't do anything since the yellow bug is inside the circle with the red bugs.
